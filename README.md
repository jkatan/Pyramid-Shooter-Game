# About The game
At the start of the match, a pyramid made of cubes with random colors appears in front of the players. Players can score points by shooting the cubes of the pyramid. When a cube is destroyed, all adyacent cubes of the same color are destroyed, generating a chain reaction.
The score obtained by destroying cubes in a chain reaction is based on the fibonacci sequence. This means, 1 cube -> 1 points, 2 cubes -> 2 points, 3 cubes -> 4 points, etc ...
The game ends when all the cubes of the pyramid are destroyed. When the game ends, a scoreboard appears indicating the scores of each player in order.
